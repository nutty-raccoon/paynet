- When writing documentation, always focus on the WHY rather than the WHAT. Rust code is often self explanatory, so the doc should add value and not be simply descriptive.
- When writing documentation, adopt a detached, descriptive, cold and technical tone.
- When writing rust documentation for function, never add doctest or examples
