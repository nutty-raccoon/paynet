//! An erc20 transfer with richer event
//!
//! The sole purpose of this contract is to provide the ability to pass a transfer reference
//! in a way similar to [eip-7699](https://github.com/ethereum/ERCs/blob/master/ERCS/erc-7699.md).
//!
//! We use it during the mint process:
//! 1. the user require a mint quote form the node, it comes with an UUID.
//! 2. the user deposit to the node address using this Invoice contract,
//     providing a felt build using `from_bytes_be` on the hash of this UUID as `invoice_id`
//! 3. the node listen to on-chain deposit to its address, and use the `invoice_id` to flag the
//! correct quote as `PAID`
//! 4. the user call the node's `mint` route with the original UUID and receive the corresponding
//! amount of tokens
