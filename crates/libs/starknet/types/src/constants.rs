//! Network-specific Configuration Constants
//!
//! This module provides a centralized location for all network-specific constants
//! used throughout the application. By organizing constants into a single map indexed
//! by network identifier, we ensure consistent configuration across the application
//! and simplify network switching.
//!
//! The `phf` crate is used to create compile-time static maps, which guarantees
//! zero runtime overhead when accessing these constants.
